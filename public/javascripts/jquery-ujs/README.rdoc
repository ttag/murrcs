Unobtrusive jQuery with Rails 3

== Automated Installation

=== Step 1

Add this line to your Gemfile:

  gem 'jquery-rails'

=== Step 2

Run this command:

  $ rails generate jquery:install # --ui if you want jQuery UI

=== Step 3

There is no step three.


== Manual installation

jQuery 1.4, 1.4.1, 1.4.2 and 1.4.3 can be used. However because of http://jsbin.com/uboxu3/7/ issue which is present in jQuery 1.4.2 version, it is highly
recommended to use jQuery 1.4.3.

=== Step 1

Download jQuery from http://docs.jquery.com/Downloading_jQuery and put the file in public/javascripts - for example, the file might be:

  public/javascripts/jquery-1.4.3.min.js

=== Step 2

Copy rails.js from http://github.com/rails/jquery-ujs/raw/master/src/rails.js into public/javascripts - overwriting the prototype one (you can also delete the other prototype files if you don't need them for anything else.)

=== Step 3 (optional)

Switch the javascript_include_tag :defaults to use jquery instead of the default prototype helpers.

file config/application.rb

  config.action_view.javascript_expansions[:defaults] = %w(jquery rails application)
